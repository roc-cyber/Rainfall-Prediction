# Rainfall-Prediction
Industrial Internship final project
The main objective of the study is the prediction of the rainfall using historical monthly data
based on the Machine learning methodologies or algorithms to predict the higher outcomes. The
similar data will be grouped together for the accurate and precise information that will predict the
rainfall more correctly and with perfect figures. The accurate and exact predictions will help in
developing the more appropriate strategies for agriculture and water reserves and will also be
informed about the flood to implement precautionary measures. The data for the rainfall
prediction is collected from the Kaggle dataset of Australia i.e., weatherAUS.csv file. Here, the
monthly data with all parameters of rainfall including wind speed, direction, air pressure,
humidity and temperature. 
The study will also be significant for the flood management authorities as more
precise and accurate prediction for heavy monsoon rains will keep the authorities alert and
focused for an upcoming event that of which the destruction could be minimized by taking
precautionary measures. The rainfall prediction will impressively help in dealing with the
increasing issue of water resource management; as water is a scarce resource and it needs to get
saved for the benefit of human beings themselves. Also, it will help the people to manage and
plan their social activities accordingly.
